# ScreenCheck
A screen measurement tool intended for Android design testing. The app will communicate what size and density buckets the device falls into, both at install-time and at runtime, based on what the APK actually installs. Also comes with rulers so developers can visually gauge how many views of a certain size can fit into a screen and still remain visible.
